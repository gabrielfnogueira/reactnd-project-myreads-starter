# MyReads

This is a project for Udacity's React Nanodegree: React Fundamentals module. It manages what books you're currently reading, want to read and have already read.

I didn't have a lot of time to focus on this because my work has been crazy this past couple weeks, so the project is simple, focused only in the required functionality to be accepted.

## Installing / Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so in order to install and run you just need to run these `npm` commands:

```
$ npm install
```
then
```
$ npm start
```
